# physical-ai-stl — minimal runtime requirements (CS-3860)
# Python >= 3.10 (enforced in pyproject.toml)
# Keep this base lean; heavy stacks live in requirements-extra.txt.
#
# NumPy notes:
# - sliding_window_view is required by datasets (introduced in NumPy 1.20.0).
# - 1.26.4 is the last 1.x release with robust Python 3.12 wheels.
# - This repo currently uses deprecated aliases np.float/np.int in several modules;
#   these were removed in NumPy 2.0, so pin <2.0 until the code is updated.
#   (Once aliases are removed from the codebase, relax to <3.0.)
